## Getting Started

### First Launch

When you first open Hive, you'll see an empty project list. Let's add your first project!

1. Click the **"Add Project"** button
2. Navigate to any git repository on your machine
3. Select the repository folder and click "Open"

Hive will analyze your repository and display it in the sidebar.

### Understanding the Interface

Hive's interface is divided into three main areas:

- **Left Sidebar**: Projects and worktrees navigation
- **Main Pane**: Active worktree content, file viewer, or AI session
- **Right Panel**: File tree, git status, and other contextual tools

## Core Concepts

### Projects vs Worktrees

- **Project**: A git repository on your machine
- **Worktree**: An isolated working copy of a specific branch

Think of worktrees as parallel universes for your code — each one can have different branches checked out simultaneously without affecting others.

### Why Worktrees?

Traditional git workflow:
```bash
git stash
git checkout feature-branch
# Work on feature
git stash
git checkout main
git stash pop
```

With Hive worktrees:
- Click on the worktree for `feature-branch`
- Work on feature
- Click on the worktree for `main`
- Both remain exactly as you left them!

## Working with Projects

### Adding Projects

You can add projects in multiple ways:

1. **GUI Method**: Click "Add Project" button
2. **Drag and Drop**: Drag a git repository folder into Hive
3. **Command Palette**: Press `Cmd+K` and type "Add Project"

### Project Actions

Right-click on any project to:
- Open in Finder
- Open in Terminal
- Copy repository path
- Remove from Hive (doesn't delete files)
- View project settings

### Project Organization

Projects can be organized into Spaces (see [Using Spaces](#using-spaces)) and pinned for quick access.

## Managing Worktrees

### Creating a Worktree

1. Select a project
2. Click **"New Worktree"**
3. Choose an existing branch or create a new one
4. Hive automatically assigns a unique city-based name (e.g., "tokyo", "paris")

### Worktree Naming

Hive uses a clever naming system:
- Each worktree gets a city name from a pool of 200+ cities
- If a city is taken, it adds a version suffix (-v1, -v2, etc.)
- You can rename worktrees after creation

### Worktree Actions

- **Open**: Click to open the worktree in the main pane
- **Archive**: Safely remove the worktree while preserving the branch
- **Unbranch**: Remove the worktree and delete the branch
- **Terminal**: Open a terminal in the worktree directory
- **Copy Path**: Copy the worktree's file system path

### Archived Worktrees

Archived worktrees are moved to `~/.hive-archive` and can be:
- Restored later if needed
- Permanently deleted to free up space
- Searched in session history

## AI Coding Sessions

### Starting a Session

1. Open a worktree
2. Click **"New Session"**
3. Choose your AI provider:
   - **OpenCode**: Full-featured with undo/redo support
   - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's coding assistant

### During a Session

#### Giving Instructions
Type your request in the chat input. Be specific about what you want:
- ✅ "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page"
- ❌ "Make it better"

#### Tool Permissions
When the AI needs to perform actions, you'll see permission requests:
- **Read files**: Allow the AI to read specific files
- **Write files**: Allow modifications to files
- **Run commands**: Execute terminal commands

Always review what the AI wants to do before approving!

#### Undo/Redo
- **OpenCode**: Full undo/redo support with `Cmd+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z`
- **Claude Code**: Undo only (rewind to previous state)

### Session Management

- **Pause**: Temporarily stop the session
- **Resume**: Continue a paused session
- **Archive**: Save the session for later reference
- **Export**: Export chat history as markdown

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clear instructions get better results
2. **Review Changes**: Always review AI-generated code
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test changes as you go
4. **Use Undo**: Don't hesitate to undo if something goes wrong
5. **Save Context**: Archive important sessions for reference

## Connections

Hive's Worktree Connections feature allows you to link two worktrees together, creating powerful workflows for development across multiple branches.

### Understanding Worktree Connections

Worktree connections create a bridge between two branches, allowing you to:
- View and reference code from another branch while working
- Share AI session context across branches
- Compare implementations side-by-side
- Maintain awareness of related changes

### Creating Your First Connection

1. Open a worktree (your "source")
2. Click the **Connections** icon (🔌) in the toolbar
3. Select **"Connect to Worktree"**
4. Choose the target worktree from the list
5. The connection is established immediately

### Connection Types

#### Reference Connections
Keep another branch visible for reference:
- Main branch while working on features
- Previous implementation during refactors
- Documentation branch while coding

#### Collaboration Connections
Work on related features simultaneously:
- Frontend and backend branches
- API and client implementations
- Shared library and consumer branches

#### Comparison Connections
Compare different approaches:
- Performance optimizations
- Alternative implementations
- Before/after refactoring

### Using Connected Worktrees

#### The Connection Panel
When worktrees are connected, you'll see:
- **File Browser** - Browse files from the connected worktree
- **Changes View** - See what's different in the connected branch
- **Quick Actions** - Switch, diff, or copy between worktrees
- **Status Bar** - Connection health and sync status

#### Navigating Between Connected Worktrees
- Click the connection indicator to switch
- Use `Cmd+Shift+W` to toggle between connected worktrees
- Drag files from one worktree to another
- Open files from both worktrees side-by-side

#### Sharing Context
Connected worktrees share:
- File references (read-only by default)
- AI session context (when enabled)
- Terminal output (optional)
- Git status information

### Advanced Features

#### Smart Diff View
Compare files between connected worktrees:
1. Select a file in your current worktree
2. Click "Compare with Connected"
3. See a side-by-side diff
4. Apply changes selectively

#### AI Session Sharing
AI sessions can access both worktrees:
```
"Look at the implementation in the connected worktree and apply the same pattern here"
```

#### Connection Persistence
Connections are remembered:
- Survive Hive restarts
- Restore when worktrees are reopened
- Can be saved as connection profiles

#### Connection Templates
Save common connection patterns:
- "Feature + Main" template
- "Frontend + Backend" template
- "Bug Fix + Production" template

### Connection Management

#### Connection States
- 🟢 **Active** - Both worktrees open and synced
- 🟡 **Standby** - One worktree closed but connection saved
- 🔴 **Broken** - Target worktree archived or deleted
- 🔄 **Syncing** - Updating file references

#### Multiple Connections
A worktree can connect to multiple others:
- Maximum of 3 connections per worktree
- Each connection has its own panel
- Switch between connections with tabs

#### Disconnecting
To disconnect worktrees:
1. Click the connection icon
2. Select "Disconnect"
3. Or use `Cmd+Shift+D` shortcut

### Best Practices

1. **Connect Related Work** - Link branches that share context
2. **Use for Reviews** - Connect author and reviewer worktrees
3. **Maintain Main Connection** - Keep main branch connected for reference
4. **Clean Up Stale Connections** - Disconnect archived worktrees
5. **Name Connections** - Give meaningful names to connection profiles

### Tips and Tricks

#### Quick Connection Workflow
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+C` to open connection dialog
2. Type partial worktree name
3. Press Enter to connect
4. Use `Cmd+Shift+W` to switch

#### Connection Shortcuts
- `Cmd+Shift+C` - Connect worktrees
- `Cmd+Shift+W` - Switch between connected
- `Cmd+Shift+D` - Disconnect
- `Cmd+Option+D` - Diff with connected

#### Visual Indicators
Look for these connection indicators:
- 🔗 in the sidebar - Worktree has connections
- Badge number - Shows connection count
- Color coding - Active (green), standby (yellow)
- Animation - Pulsing when syncing
